        <h2>Rabindranath Tagore</h2>

        <p>
          Rabindranath Tagore (7 May 1861 â€“ 7 August 1941) was a Bengali
          polymath who worked as a poet, writer, playwright, composer,
          philosopher, social reformer, and painter of the Bengal Renaissance.
          He reshaped Bengali literature and music as well as Indian art with
          Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author
          of the "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful" poetry of
          Gitanjali. In 1913, Tagore became the first non-European to win a
          Nobel Prize in any category, and also the first lyricist to win the
          Nobel Prize in Literature. Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as
          spiritual and mercurial; where his elegant prose and magical poetry
          were widely popular in the Indian subcontinent. He was a fellow of the
          Royal Asiatic Society. Referred to as "the Bard of Bengal", Tagore was
          known by the sobriquets Gurudeb, Kobiguru, and Biswokobi.
